# ES2015 - Introduction 

tl;dr ES6 = ECMAScript6, ECMAScript version 6 which was released in 2015.

## What is ES6

tl;dr ES6 is a standardised verison of javascript.

ECMAScript is a standard for a scripting language which is overseen by ECMA International. ECMA International is an internal standards organisation founded in 1961 as a means to normalise Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and Consumer Electronics (CE).

## Why?

tl;dr Microsoft sucks.

In the mid 1990's, when web browsers were being created into the form we are familar with today, there was a requirement for a scripting language that could run on the client side. The idea was to create a lightweight language that could run small applications on the client side.

Originally named Mocha, this language was created in 10 days by Brendan Eich and bundled in Netscape Navigator 2.0's beta release in September 1995 as LiveScript. The language was rebranded as JavaScript, an action that has been seen as a marketing tactic to leverage off the name of the then popular Java language.

As a means to ensure Javascript's future against Microsoft's rival client side scripting language JScript, Netscape submitted the scripting language to ECMA International. This resulted in ECMA International's standardised scripting language, EMCAScript.

With the release of FireFox in 2002, Mozilla followed the ECMAScript standards and Chrome following suit with Chrome in 2008 with ECMAScript becoming the defacto client side scripting language.

Since then, ECMA International have provided specifications for ECMAScript, which modern browsers supporting Javascript have closely followed.
