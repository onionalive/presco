# Notes and Issues

## DEC 14th

- POST Create account successful, but you cannot use the same mobile number fields (which causes issues for reiteration)
- Waiting on a PUT update membership example for terminating
- GET Member cards currently returning 400
- GET Transactions fetching is okay
- GET Membership fetching is okay
- Transaction accordian logic 
- Changed every certificate for the app bundle change, but this took forever - we need to decide on an app bundle, name and resolve the accounts
- Re-added the Login functionality but there are currently issues with chained requests to grab other information (Russell suggested a solution)
- Added back in push notifications with the new certificate
- Added back in the updated Firebase stuff
- Create the .p12 file and password but currently not in the email thread, just with me. Sent email replies.
